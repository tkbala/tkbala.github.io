I am Senior Researcher at Microsoft Research. I work on leveraging Generative AI models (LLMs and Diffusion models) to enhance user productivity and collaboration in business-critical applications. I am particularly interested in customizing, finetuning, and aligning generative AI models for specific end-user applications.

Before joining Microsoft, I completed my Ph.D. at the University of California, Berkeley where I was advised by Prof. Bj√∂rn Hartmann. My research at Berkeley was concentrated in the domains of Virtual and Augmented Reality, exploring applications in diverse activities, from AR/VR-assisted robotics interactions to enhancing learning experiences.  Before that, I completed my Bachelors at Indian Institute of Technology, Madras where my Bachelors' thesis won the best interdisciplinary thesis project amongst all engineering departments and the best thesis in the department.
